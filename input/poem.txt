A woman behind a tree 
Sneaks on by 
Carelessly, as she is free. 

There is space here, 
And she uses it all
But somehow, her being is small. 

A step on green moss, 
A bed of clovers, 
Here the water trickles over and over.

There are no voices, 
No planes in the sky 
Just a woman sneaking on by 

There are no written rules, 
But yet there are many 
Abundance and life available in plenty
